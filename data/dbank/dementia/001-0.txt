um.
mhm. 
  alright.  
there's um a young boy that's getting a cookie jar.
and it  he's uh in bad shape because uh the thing is falling over.
and in the picture the mother is washing dishes and doesn't see it.
and so is the  the water is overflowing in the sink.
and the dishes might get falled  over if you don't  fell  fall over there  there if you don't get it.
and it  there  it's a picture of a kitchen window.
and the curtains are very uh distinct.
but the water is flow still flowing.
